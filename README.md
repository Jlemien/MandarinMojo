ChineseCharacterChallenge
=========================

This is a HTML 5 game to help me (and hopefully other) practice Mandarin character comprehension.

It is based on a basic game prototype I prepared earlier. https://github.com/andyjdavis/EndlessGoblin

The prototype is itself inspired by a Lost Decade tutorial (http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/) The background image, the character and the goblin are from Lost Decade.

The code is all by Andrew Davis (http://www.thetravelingprogrammer.com)

The fireball animation is from http://opengameart.org/content/fireball-spell

The explosion animation is from http://opengameart.org/content/explosion
