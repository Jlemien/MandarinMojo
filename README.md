ChineseCharacterChallenge
=========================

This is a HTML 5 game to help me, and hopefully others, practice Mandarin character comprehension.

It is based on a basic game prototype that I prepared earlier. https://github.com/andyjdavis/EndlessGoblin

The prototype is itself inspired by a Lost Decade tutorial http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/

The background image, the character image and the goblin image are from Lost Decade.

The code is all by Andrew Davis http://www.thetravelingprogrammer.com https://github.com/andyjdavis/ChineseCharacterChallenge.git

The word/character lists are from http://www.hskhsk.com/word-lists.html

The success sound is from http://www.freesound.org/people/grunz/sounds/109662/

The failure sounds is from http://soundbible.com/992-Right-Cross.html

The graphics are from http://open.commonly.cc  www.kenney.nl
