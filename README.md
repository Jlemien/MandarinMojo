ChineseCharacterChallenge
=========================

This is a HTML 5 game to help me, and hopefully others, practice Mandarin character comprehension.

It is based on a basic game prototype that I prepared earlier. https://github.com/andyjdavis/EndlessGoblin

The prototype is itself inspired by a Lost Decade tutorial http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/

The background image, the character image and the goblin image are from Lost Decade.

The code is all by Andrew Davis http://www.thetravelingprogrammer.com https://github.com/andyjdavis/ChineseCharacterChallenge.git

The word/character lists are from http://www.hskhsk.com/word-lists.html

The success sound is from http://www.freesound.org/people/grunz/sounds/109662/

The failure sounds is from http://soundbible.com/992-Right-Cross.html

The graphics are from http://open.commonly.cc  www.kenney.nl

TODO

- enemies get quicker as you move up the levels?

- if you press alphabetic keys from within the game, it carries out the desired function, but also opens the "quick search" function, which deselects the game screen

- audio not working for some.

- bosses

- a way to quit

- variety. powerups? faster, do more damage, take more hits? change theme? field to graveyard to mountains to castle to space ship?

- import Anki deck

- have sample sentences with a blank and find the word that fits in the blank.

- graphics should have something to do with china

- make point and click?

- Tell the player they can press h for high scores

- user can enter arenas. Arenas are marked complete.

- improve review arena problem queue.
store words sorted for the user by difficulty (wrong answers, time to pick correct).
only words you got wrong in review?

- User can view list of words sorted by difficulty. Problem words at top.
